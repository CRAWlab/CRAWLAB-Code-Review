# <span style="font-family: 'Fugaz One', cursive;">C.R.A.W.LAB</span> Code Reviews

This repository contains code from code-reviews held during <span style="font-family: 'Fugaz One', cursive;">C.R.A.W.LAB</span> group meetings. Each folder should contain the code reviewed, along with a README explaining it.

We will do a code review as part of "normal" presentations during the weekly group meeting. You should present a snippet or section of your code that:

* is unique/important,     

* was/is troublesome, and/or    

* is useful to other students/projects.

The code can be Python, LaTeX, ROS, C, MicroPython, or any other language that we are working in.

## Process

To enable this, the code review process is:

* Add a folder to the [https://github.com/CRAWlab/CRAWLAB-Code-Review CRAWLAB code review repository] in format `YYYYmmdd_lastname_topic`. For example: 
    - `20180110_Vaughan_example` 
    - `20180821_Eaglin_pathPlanning`

* Send link to the file on GitHub to Slack code channel by noon on Friday before your presentation

* Add a README.md file in the GitHub folder that explains the snippet. In that README file:
    - Point to line numbers to look at
    - Explain the usage of the code, etc
    - Discusses the <em>why</em> not just what

* Another option is put all, including description of usage in a Jupyter Notebook

* We will review. All lab members should bring questions/comments to meeting. Lab members can also add comments and discussion to GitHub commit. This is harder to do with Jupyter Notebook reviews.
